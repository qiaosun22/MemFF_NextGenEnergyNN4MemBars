In this work, we proposed a simple deep neural network architecture augmented by a physical local learning (PhyLL) algorithm, enabling supervised and unsupervised training of deep physical neural networks without detailed knowledge of the nonlinear physical layer’s properties. We trained diverse wave-based physical neural networks in vowel and image classification experiments, showcasing our approach’s universality. Our method shows advantages over other hardware-aware training schemes by improving training speed, enhancing robustness, and reducing power consumption through eliminating the need for system modeling and thus decreasing digital computation.
